/**

 *   HAPTICS — The Invisible Half of Tactility
 *
 *   Haptics are the period at the end of a visual sentence. They confirm
 *   what the eye already saw. Used sparingly, they make an app feel alive.
 *   Used too often, they make a phone feel broken.
 *
 *   This helper wraps expo-haptics with an intent-based API. Callers say
 *   `haptic.tap()`, not `Haptics.impactAsync(...)`. The helper hides the
 *   library, so we can swap implementations later without touching callers.
 *
 *   Android note: haptic support varies by device. expo-haptics degrades
 *   gracefully (no-ops on unsupported hardware) so we never wrap in try/catch.
 *
 *   Principle: haptics accompany motion, never replace it. If an animation
 *   happens, a haptic may reinforce it. Silent actions stay silent.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
